# PWT: Matlab Code #

<!--
The code is currently simply copied to the Econ821 repo.
-->

## Directory structure:

`baseDir`: 

* `outDir`: figures and tables

* `matDir`: generated `mat` files

* `dataDir`: original data files

* `progDir`: program files

## Programs ##

The code is entirely general purpose (not specific to the course).

* `go_pwt8`	startup; add dir to path	 
* `const_pwt8`	set constants	 
* `run_all_pwt8`	runs everything in sequence  
* `import_pwt8`	imports stata file into matlab	 
* `var_load_yc_pwt8`	loads one variable by [Country,year] 
* `country_list_pwt8`	makes list of countries and years	 

## Basic Steps ###

1. Download Stata file.

2. Make Stata file into a matlab `dataset` using [Stat/Transfer](https://www.stattransfer.com/)

3. `import_pwt8`: break the Stata file into individual variables and save them as matlab matrices, indexed by [year, country]

4. `var_load_yc_pwt8`: loads one variable for a given set of years and countries

## Exercises #

1. Write code that imports the stata file (`import_pwt8`)
2. Write `var_load_yc_pwt8`
2. Plot the density of real output per worker in 2000 (`rgdp_density_growth821`).
1. Plot the price of consumption against real gdp per worker for the year 2000.
