# World Development Indicators #

A collection of cross country data on

* gdp and its components

* employment

* demographics

* education

* government finances

* and much more

## Getting the Data #

One typically downloads one variable at a time from [here](http://databank.worldbank.org/).

The best format is probably xls.

One gets a file with years as columns.

## Getting the Data Into Matlab ##

Replace the column headers for the years with something that makes a valid variable name (e.g. x1970).

Run through [Stat/Transfer](www.stattransfer.com) to obtain a Matlab dataset.

Load the file into matlab. Convert the data portion of the matrix into a matrix by [year, country].

Country indicators are World Bank WITS codes (essentially the same as ISO codes).

The code now directly reads the xls file

## Matlab Code #

### Directories ###

* prog: programs

* excel: raw `xls` files and generated `mat` files (one for each variable)

* outDir: tables and figures

### Programs

* `const_wdi2013`: set constants
* `var_load_yc_wdi2013`: load one variable by [country, year]
* `country_list_wdi2013`: make a list of all countries in the data (WITS codes)

## Exercises #

1. Construct GDP per worker (i.e. per employed person) in constant international dollars.
	1. Save it as a Matlab matrix by [country, year].
	2. How does it compare with PWT data?

2. Plot the fraction of self-employed workers against GDP per capita in constant international dollars. For the year 2000.
What do you find?

3. Download a variable from the WDI web site and import it into Matlab.
