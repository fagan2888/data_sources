# Barro-Lee Schooling Data #

The standard dataset for working with cross-country schooling data.

Covers educational attainment by [year, country, age group, sex].

How is this constructed?

* mainly from household surveys
* since there are not many surveys for most countries, there is a lot of interpolation

## Getting the Data #

Download Stata files from the [Barro-Lee web site](http://www.barrolee.com/).

Each row is a country / year.

Each column is a variable.

Each file is one sex.

## Importing Into Matlab ##

Make the Stata file into a Matlab `dataset` using Stat/Transfer.

Write a function `var_load_yc_bl2013` that extracts one variable for a given set of years and countries.
